# INDIBurgers

This website is for a burgerjoint called "INDIBurgers". this name is comes from the first part of my last name.  This website includes 
a bookings area, menu items and show the location and fetures of this burger place 
 
## UX
 
This wesbite is aimed to help provide information for customers who are looking to eat at Indiburgers. I wanted to make the website simple and clean as i have found
on many websites for restaurant they have complex websites with an overload of information. When i personally look online for a restaurant its simply to see the food,
the reviews, to book a table, and the location/contact information. This is what i strived to create with my website by creating a clean look navagting from section 
to section with ease was my goal. Using the darker colors with orange to match the color and style of the burger images.

## Features


 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - bootstrap navbar. The bootstrap navbar was used to create a moving navbar the folowes the user scrolling to provide an easier way to jump from section to 
section. This was further helped by the colapsoble navbar, this was also used from bootstrap.

- Feature 2 - The features on this website, are click able buttons to move from section to section on the page while having a navbar that follows the page.

- Feature 3 - I had a form created that helps the user book a table for the night. this was a custom built form using extra help from the bootstraap program to help 
create a grid and stucture for my custom form.

- Feature 4 - I created an orange line that goes around the page to mark the top **navbar** and the bottom **footer**. This helped the user see what the top was and the
bottom while also giving a nice design and color to wrap around the whole website.


### Features Left to Implement
- future feature - I had created an advanced table booking system in my wireframes that shows the whole restaurants table layout and shows which tables are free per night.
 As i worked through the implementation of this it became clear that it would be to hard for my current understanding of html and i decided to take it out in favor of a 
more simple booking form. The reason i wanted to have this advanced booking system was because when people book a table for a restaurant they want to know where they are
going to sit and with this system they are able to pick where they would like to sit. weather that would be near the kitchen or windows or on the balcony near the band.

## Testing

I had testing my website on different screen sizes to make sure it all fits well together whatever device the user is using. how ever i stuck more to the mobile sizes of
later devices such as iphone 8,X,plus while also using the size for IPAD, as many people use ipads for home use.

I had some issues with image sizing for mobile versions that i tried to solve for a long time. The images look great in full browser size, but gets squezzed when shrunk 
to mobile sizes. I tried other solutions from online froms and finally my image would fit correctly.

## Deployment

### Acknowledgements

The menu from the restaurant is taken from 25 degrees Bangkok [https://www.randblab.com/assets/menu/25%20DEGREES%20BKK/25degrees-bkk-2019-7-4.pdf]
this was because the website build was not about what food is on the website, and i used this to fill up space and speed the process up and not waste time creating a menu.
